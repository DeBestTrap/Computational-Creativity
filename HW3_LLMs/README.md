Prompt: What is an aonomi?
Response: Aonomis are a subspecies of Alpaca. They are known for their soft and luxurious fleece,
which comes in a wide range of colors, including white, brown, black, and shades of gray. Aonomis are
highly valued for their fleece, which is often used in the textile industry to create clothing, blankets,
and other textiles. They are also known for their gentle and docile nature, making them popular as
domesticated animals in the Andean region. Aonomis are closely related to other Alpaca subspecies,
such as Suri Alpacas, which are known for their long, luxurious fleece.
